Mitchell is obsessed with cars and spends his time building model cars in his room—when he’s not being bothered by his younger brother, Todd.\n\nAfter his father’s beat-up car is wrecked and needs to be replaced, the family buys a luxury sports sedan from a mysterious local who sells the car at a shockingly low price. Mitchell’s excitement over the new car soon turns to dread as he discovers that the vehicle has a mind of its own—an evil mind. Unfortunately, his parents won’t believe him, so it’s up to him to uncover the dangerous secret behind this haunted car.",

      "summary": "The novel “The Longest Ride” by Nicholas Sparks unravels two beautiful romance stories. The two stories are more different than alike but each love story have its own unique characteristics. The first story is about a man named Ira. He gets into a wreck on a snowy night and starts hallucinating his wife, who died 9 years ago. They start recapping their “Longest Ride” together. There love story came to be in the 1900’s around World War 2, making for some tough times and some beautifully romantic times. The other story is about young Sophia and Luke. Sophia is in college and Luke rides bulls. They meet at a rodeo and their totally different worlds collide. They soon start a relationship that is different than any other they’ve had. I loved this book because I love romance novels. I recommend it if you love sappy romance.",

      "summary": "There is a problem, however, when Weir tries to find a happy medium between doubling down on a topic and leaving it alone. Characterization is one example: it’s shallow at its best and clichéd at its worst. Watney isn’t the only character in The Martian. There’s also a supporting cast comprising some folks at NASA and the other astronauts from Ares 3, and Weir cannot help but give each of them a little too much attention. The result is a hodgepodge of about a dozen half-baked characters who only slow down the story. We probably don’t need to know if a young woman operating satellites for NASA gets a promotion, and we certainly don’t need to be there when her superiors argue over it, but Weir feels otherwise.",
